# Tracking San Francisco's Microclimates with the Arduino MKR1000

In April, Arduino launched the new MKR1000 board, a move that I’m sure made countless IoT fanatics, including myself, jump for joy. The MKR1000 integrates the functionalities of the Arduino Uno and a WiFi shield into one neat little two-inch board, making it easier than ever to add all sorts of objects to the “Internet of Things”. With its small size and built-in WiFi capabilities, this little device presents the perfect opportunity for anyone to use PubNub’s global data stream network to transmit data from practically anywhere.

To prove that point, I set out creating this demo, in which I’ll walk through how to set up the MKR1000 with PubNub and then use it to transmit temperature data from different locations within San Francisco, a city known for its microclimates. If you follow along, you’ll have access to temperature data from any locations you choose, and you’ll be able to monitor it in realtime. To top it all off, I’ll show you how to use both the EON Chart Builder and Mapbox Editor to present the data in just a few easy steps. Check out the full tutorial on the PubNub blog.
